# dbcx-aperture-modules
A modular system for creating Portal 2 testing chambers in Lego

## Welcome!
This repository is a place for any person to create and modify the Modular Portal Testing Chamber project. See "Contributing to the project" for how to share your modifications with everyone.

## Getting Started

### Getting the files to build your own
It's as easy as downloading them! The fastest way might be to clone the entire repository, so you get everything. There are tutorials how to do this online. If you want a few specific files, it might be easiest to download those on their own. I'd ask that you also download the license from this repository. 

### Contributing to the project
Here's the process we'll use to incorporate community improvements to the project:
* 
Fork your own copy of this repository, and make a new branch for your changes. Please only change files in your branch. When you are ready to contribute to the main repository, create a pull request.

## Code of Conduct
Be cool, and don't be uncool. Let's make this a good experience for everyone involved, we're here to design and discuss the ultimate Lego version of modular aperture from Portal and Portal 2. 

## Organization
Files representing the most atomic elements are most useful. They allow easier comparisons between versions of an element. If proposing a new design, or modifying an element design, please submit a file containing only the element designed. Feel free to also submit example test chambers where the element is incorporated.

A "current" version of each element will live in a current folder, while previous replaced versions will be stored in an archive folder containing versions of previous elements. A subfolder will contain current example tests. When a piece of an example test is replaced, that test will be relegated to the archive folder. This preserves the invariant that "everything in the current folder is current".

A tutorial folder will exist to share information about topics like rendering.
